# Star Cluster Simulator
Uneven distribution of gas in space allows the accretion of material to form protostars: the start of a star's life cycle!

The star cluster simulator, as the name suggests, simulates a section of space through the process, life, and death of the stars within. Like stars in our own galaxy, all start as a protostar collecting material. Most will move on to form main sequence stars and may soon become a red giant. Red giants end with an explosive supernova, depositing much of its mass as gas into its surrounding and leaving behind its core as a black hole or neutron star. The smaller main sequence stars die in the slightly less explosive planetary nebula, something that has nothing to do with planets despite the name.

Time is divided into 1 million year increments, after which the position, surface temperature color, and mass of all stellar objects are written into the star cluster's csv file for the increment's time period. This program does not include a visualizer. An external 3-dimensional graph program will be needed to show what the cluster looks like at different times.
